# This script should accept the full message as input on stdin, and print a URL on stdout that contains the full message
# This might be done by e.g. putting a file in the local filesystem in the correct location for a webserver to pick it up:

#data="$(cat)"
#md5="$(echo "$data" | md5sum | cut -d' ' -f1)"
#echo "$data" > "/some/webserver/directory/$md5.txt"
#echo "http://some.webserver/directory/$md5.txt"

# or by posting it to an external paste service for low-volume/non-sensitive-content pastes

#curl -sF 'f:1=<-' ix.io

echo 'Pastes not configured, see external/paste'
